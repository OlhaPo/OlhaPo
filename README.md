### Hey there! My name is Olya, I'm a junior frontend developer 👩‍💻

+ I'm currently studying full stack engineering at Codecademy.
+ I'm currently working on some pet projects to improve my coding skills.
+ I'm looking to collaborate on some cool websites and web applications where I can gain more experience.
+ Aside from web development I love hiking, sewing, knitting, playing the ukulele, postcrossing and cats 😸
